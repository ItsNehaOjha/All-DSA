							Java CheetSheet notes 

* There are three types of languages (classification of programming languages based on their programming paradigm, which defines the style and structure of the code.):: 
					i)   Procedural :- Systematic code with many rules like C
					ii)  Functional :- works only with functions used in ML
					iii) Object oriented :- Works with objects (code + data = object) like JAVA , C++ 
					- use all three = PYTHON , C#, JS

*Two types of language on basis of different characteristics of languages or aspects of language usage. 
		lst) STATIC :- Involves analyzing code without executing it (in compile time). It includes techniques like code reviews, 			       syntax checking, and type checking performed at compile-time. In this pre defining of variable is crucial .
				Eg. Java, C++, C
		2nd) DYNAMIC :- In this anylizing code occur during runtime. It includes techniques like testing, profiling, and runtime 				monitoring. Here no need to declare data types 
				Eg. Python, JS
* Key point of JAVA:- 
		1) Java is a static language 
		2)Memory Management in Java: -Heap Memory - it stores the reference variable
					     -Static Memory - it stores the object of that variable
					* More than one reference variable can point to single object
					* If There is a object without reference variable that that object will be destroyed by Garbage 					   Collector.
